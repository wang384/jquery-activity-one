# jQuery Activity One

This repository contains a number of small jQuery code examples. If you look in the JavaScript files (`.js`), you'll see a number of code comments like this: `/* FIXME */`. Read the code comments to figure out what you should do, and look for the `/* FIXME */` hints for where you should add or change code.
